## Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### University of British Columbia \| Master's in Data Science \| 2019

*Skills Acquired:*
- Hypothesis development and testing using statistical analysis.
- Supervised & unsupervised machine learning: random forests, kNN, SVM, linear/logistic regression, GLM, clustering (k-means, k-medians), NLP, Naive Bayes, meta-ensembles (model stacking), boosting (XGBoost), neural networks, CNNs, time series modelling, dimensionality reduction with PCA.
- Model performance estimation for regression: RMSE, MAE, R2; and classification: accuracy, precision, recall, AUROC
- Coursework using AWS, Docker, Codecov, Tensorflow, Keras
- Version control with Git and Github
- Data Wrangling with SQL, Excel, APIs, web scraping (HTML & JSON)
- Data visualization in R with ggplot2 and Shiny, in Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn 



*Capstone Project:*
- **Partner company:** Tetrad
- **Team size:** 4
- **Project scope:** Predict the success of a potential new franchise location for a restaurant chain.
- **Language used:** R
- **Project description:** 
    - Created a predictive analytics tool that leverages demographic, business, and traffic data in geographic zones to predict the success of opening a franchise location at a given location by predicting its potential profitability. This supervised learning model that can be used across multiple industries by any established B2C chain/franchise company.
    - *Feature selection:* the algorithm scans through thousands of data variables and uses greedy selection to choose variables most predictive of success/failure for the company.
    - *Modelling:* Meta-ensembling (model stacking) used to reduce error (+/- 15% of true value), prevent overfitting, and alleviate single-algorithm biases. Algorithm selects between linear regression and/or random forests regressor (based on lowest RMSE) for use in the final stacked model.
    - *Report generation:* Produces automated report that estimates the quality of the predictions using statistical error measurements (RMSE, MAE, classification accuracy) and informs about the variables selected by the algorithm.
- **Process:**
    - Extensive exploratory data analysis which included using graphing for feature visualization, correlation matrix, and linear/non-linear base models – in both R and Python.
    - Explored linear and non-linear machine learning techniques including linear/logistic regression, random forests, SVM, boosted decision trees, and kNN – in both R and Python. Evaluated regression models using RMSE, R2, and MAE, evaluated classification models using accuracy, recall, and precision.
    - Explored feature selection techniques based on Pearson correlation, regression weights, regularization, and greedy selection to pick approximately 150 strongest features from 2700 while maintaining interpretability.
    - Created custom greedy selection algorithm that selects variables for a stacked (two-level) model without violating the validation set in the selection process. 
- **My role:** Primary developer of our variable selection, stacked model, and report generator scripts.
- **Note:** Certain details of this project are protected by an NDA, but I am happy to answer questions about our project approach, steps taken in problem solving, and methods/algorithms used.
