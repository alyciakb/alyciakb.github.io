## Work Experience
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### TransLink \| November 2019 - Present \| Analytics Professional in Training

As a member of the Research and Analytics department, I worked on projects that assist stakeholders in various departments throughout the company, including planning, marketing, finance, and business technology services.
  - Created a machine learning model in Python that used DBSCAN, k-means, and LDA to segment over 2 million yearly Compass Card customers into 6 classes based on their weekly usage.
      - Monitored and reported the stability of the classes, retention of customers, make-up of the classes by fare type, movement of customers over time, and growth/loss of the customer base by class.
      - Became a source of ridership information and reporting throughout the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the segmentation model, along with other Compass Tap data to monitor and report the changes in ridership during COVID-19 by class of customer, time of day, fare payment method, and city of trip origin. This data has been reported to various stakeholders in planning, marketing, and the customer experience committee.
  - Developed a PowerBI dashboard, SQL, and Python processes to automate COVID-19 related weekly and monthly overall ridership reports for various internal and external stakeholders, including Finance, Planning, CUTA, and UITP. 
  - Worked in a cross-functoinal team with Business Technology Services to test and review cloud-based data storage platforms, Snowflake and Azure, and their integration with DataBricks and Tableau.
  - Developed linear regression models to predict daily and weekly transit ridership using external data sources, with a mean average weekly accuracy of 99.3%. This data assists finance and planning with decision making while internal data reporting systems are offline.


##### Silvercreek Realty Group \| 2015 - 2018 \| Marketing Associate

Member of the Business Development Team that grew the company into a top-100 brokerage in the US (based on gross sales), increased the number of real estate agents at the company by over 60%, from 800 to 1300 agents, and obtained yearly production growth of over 20%.
- Responsible for tracking internal recruiting and retention statistics, identifying areas for improvement and presenting those findings to the BusDev and management teams.
- Tracked and reported monthly, quarterly, and yearly brokerage sales statistics.
- Mobile & electronic communications manager between the brokerage and the 1300 real estate agents.
- Designed, automated, and tracked performance metrics of internal and external marketing campaigns developed for either recruiting or retaining real estate agents.
- Assisted in website design and development for the internal and external brokerage websites.
- Core team member for the development of a 14-week agent training program and managed ongoing distribution of the program.

## Education
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### University of British Columbia \| Master's in Data Science \| 2019

*Skills Acquired:*
- Hypothesis development and testing using statistical analysis.
- Supervised & unsupervised machine learning for both regression and classification.
- Model performance estimation for regression: RMSE, MAE, R2; and classification: accuracy, precision, recall, AUROC
- Coursework using AWS, Docker, Codecov, Tensorflow, Keras
- Version control with Git and Github
- Data Wrangling with SQL, Excel, APIs, web scraping (HTML & JSON)
- Data visualization in R with ggplot2 and Shiny, in Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn 



*Capstone Project:*
- **Partner company:** Tetrad
- **Team size:** 4
- **Project scope:** Predict the success of a potential new franchise location for a restaurant chain.
- **Language used:** R
- **Project description:** 
    - Created a predictive analytics tool that leverages demographic, business, and traffic data in geographic zones to predict the success of opening a franchise location at a given location by predicting its potential profitability. This supervised learning model that can be used across multiple industries by any established B2C chain/franchise company.
    - *Feature selection:* the algorithm scans through thousands of data variables and uses greedy selection to choose variables most predictive of success/failure for the company.
    - *Modelling:* Meta-ensembling (model stacking) used to reduce error (+/- 15% of true value), prevent overfitting, and alleviate single-algorithm biases. Algorithm selects between linear regression and/or random forests regressor (based on lowest RMSE) for use in the final stacked model.
    - *Report generation:* Produces automated report that estimates the quality of the predictions using statistical error measurements (RMSE, MAE, classification accuracy) and informs about the variables selected by the algorithm.
- **Process:**
    - Extensive exploratory data analysis which included using graphing for feature visualization, correlation matrix, and linear/non-linear base models – in both R and Python.
    - Explored linear and non-linear machine learning techniques including linear/logistic regression, random forests, SVM, boosted decision trees, and kNN – in both R and Python. Evaluated regression models using RMSE, R2, and MAE, evaluated classification models using accuracy, recall, and precision.
    - Explored feature selection techniques based on Pearson correlation, regression weights, regularization, and greedy selection to pick approximately 150 strongest features from 2700 while maintaining interpretability.
    - Created custom greedy selection algorithm that selects variables for a stacked (two-level) model without violating the validation set in the selection process. 
- **My role:** Primary developer of our variable selection, stacked model, and report generator scripts.
- **Note:** Certain details of this project are protected by an NDA, but I am happy to answer questions about our project approach, steps taken in problem solving, and methods/algorithms used.
