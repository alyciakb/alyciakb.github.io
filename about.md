# The Short Story

My name is Alycia Butterworth, I reside in Vancouver, and I am a recent graduate of the UBC Master's of Data Science program. In 2015, I graduated from the University of Idaho with a Bachelor's of Science business degree, specializing in both marketing and human resources, with a minor in advertising. Following my bachelor's, I worked for a real estate brokerage doing a myriad of tasks in marketing, recruiting, retention, website content creation and design. I also train and compete as an elite track and field athlete. I represented Canada at the 2017 World Track and Field Championships and my goal is to represent Canada at the 2020 Olympics.

# Education

## UBC Master's of Data Science

Through the MDS program at UBC, I was able to dive into machine learning and statistical approaches to data-driven problem solving. The course work is a mix of computer programming and statistics, along with ethics and communications courses, ending with a 2 month capstone project. During this time I developed skills in the following:

- Language Specialties: Python, R
- Data Wrangling: SQL, Excel, APIs, web scraping (HTML & JSON)
- Supervised & unsupervised machine learning
- Linear and non-linear modelling
- Data visualization and results reporting tools in R & Python
- Deep learning with neural networks and CNNs
- Basic natural language processing
- Version control with Git and Github
- Familiarity and use of AWS, Docker, Codecov

**Capstone Project:**

- *Partner company:* Tetrad
- *Team size:* 4
- *Project Scope:* Predict the success of a potential new franchise location for a restaurant chain.
- *Language Used:* R
- *Project Description:* My team worked with Tetrad to develop an algorithm that would use information from Tetrad's databases to predict the potential success of a future franchise location for a restaurant client. This was a supervised learning project that would use data from current open franchise locations and predict whether a new location was likely to perform above average or below average compared to the other franchise locations. The algorithm developed would scan through thousands of data variables (demographic and business-related information) and select the variables that are most predictive of success/failure for the company. To produce the most accurate predictions, we used meta-ensembling (model stacking). For this project, it helps alleviate biases that may occur using only one algorithm, while preventing overfitting of the data. Once trained, the algorithm produces a report that estimates the quality of its predictions using statistical practices, and can be used for predicting.
- *My Role:* I was the primary developer of our variable selection, stacked model, and report generator scripts.
- *Note:* Certain details of this project are protected by an NDA, but I am happy to answer questions about our project approach, steps taken in problem solving, and methods/algorithms used.


## University of Idaho: BS in Marketing & Human Resources

- Graduated Summa Cum Laude with a dual degree in Marketing and Human Resources, with a minor in Advertising.
- Integrated Business Curriculum included coursework in finance, accounting, project management, and information systems.
- *Other Honours:* Dean's list 2011-2015, 2013 Alumni Award for Excellence, 2-time USTFCCA Div. I all-academic honouree, 7-time conference all-academic honouree.

## Running & Other Hobbies

My primary sport is track and field and it occupies the majority of my time outside of work (or school). I competed for the track and cross country team at U of Idaho, an NCAA Division I program. During my collegiate years, I was a 4-time NCAA Outdoor Track qualifier for 3000m steeplechase, 9-time first team all-conference, 4-time second team all-conference, and represented Canada at the Junior PanAmerican Championships. After graduating, I continued running and represented Canada at the 2017 World Championships in London. I currently train and compete for Langley Mustangs Endurance Group. My goal over the next year is to qualify and compete for Canada at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. As someone who has trained and competed at an elite level through my Bachelor's, Master's, and post-collegiate job, I have developed incredible time management skills, am excellent at balancing work and running, and have an almost unparalleled drive to succeed.

I love the outdoors and being active, so I also enjoy hiking, backpacking, camping, climbing, and kayaking. I am always looking for new recommendations for backpacking trips - and enjoy recommending some of the great ones I've been on. Because of my love and use of the outdoors, I also strive to help protect it. I do what I can to reduce my carbon footprint and have an interest in renewable energy resources, packaging and waste reduction, and the use of recycled products in the creation of new products.
