As a recent graduate of the UBC Master of Data Science program, I love data-driven problem solving and am an analytical thinker. My capstone project used predictive analytics and focussed on explainability of features used. Prior to data science, I graduated from the University of Idaho with a Bachelor of Science business degree and worked for a real estate brokerage doing a myriad of tasks in marketing, recruiting, retention, website content creation and design. [More details about my capstone and prior work experience can be found on my resume.](https://alyciakb.github.io/resume/) I train and compete as an elite track and field athlete. I represented Canada at the 2017 World Track and Field Championships and my goal is to represent Canada at the 2020 Olympics. As someone who has competed at an elite level through my Bachelor's, Master's, and post-collegiate job, I have developed incredible time management skills, am excellent at balancing work and running, and have an almost unparalleled drive to succeed.

<br>

I love the outdoors and being active, so I also enjoy hiking, backpacking, camping, climbing, and kayaking. I am happy to recommend hiking spots I've been to and love hearing others' recommendations! Because of my love and use of the outdoors, I also strive to help protect it. I do what I can to reduce my carbon footprint and have an interest in renewable energy resources, packaging and waste reduction, and the use of recycled products in the creation of new products.
